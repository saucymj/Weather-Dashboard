# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

In this project I designed a website for users to be able to search up cities and get the forecast for that city. It will show the current weather and the projected weather for the next five days. There is also a list of previously searched cities for the user to click just in case they wanted to go back to a city they've previously searched. They have the option to clear out the list as well. This website was able to function from the openweather api.
